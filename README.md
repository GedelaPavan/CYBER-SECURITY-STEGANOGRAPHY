Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
Overview
This project implements a secure steganographic technique to hide sensitive data within images, making it undetectable to unauthorized users. By combining steganography with encryption, it ensures confidentiality, integrity, and security of the hidden information.

Features
✅ Advanced Steganography Techniques – Uses LSB, DCT, or DWT for secure data embedding.
✅ Encryption Support – AES/RSA encryption before embedding data.
✅ High Imperceptibility – Minimal visual distortion in the stego image.
✅ Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works on Windows, Linux, and Android.
✅ Robust Against Attacks – Resistant to compression, resizing, and steganalysis.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Command-line and GUI support for easy usage.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python (Primary), Java (Optional), MATLAB (For testing)
Libraries: OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), Stegano, PyCryptodome
Techniques: Least Significant Bit (LSB), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Public-Key Cryptography)


Future Enhancements
Machine Learning-Based Steganalysis Resistance
Cloud Storage Integration for Secure Data Sharing
Steganography in Video and Audio Files
